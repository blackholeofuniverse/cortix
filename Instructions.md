## Details
We are going to make a simple AI agent that will chat with the user and give responses accordingly

## API 
We'll be using Gogle's Gemini's API for this project

## Model
*Gemini flash 2.0

## User Interface
* The UI should be simple and easy to use, there should be a chat interface where the user can type in their questions and the AI will give responses accordingly 
* There should also be a history section where the user can see the history of their conversations 
* And also a button of "New chat" to start a new chat. Make sure to make it responsive.

## Logic
You have to make logic on your own, and make sure to do proper error handling if anything goes wrong.

## Tech Stack
* You will be using Next.js 15 for this project
* Tailwind CSS for styling
* Lucide Icons for the icons
